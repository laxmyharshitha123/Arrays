## arrays:
*an array is a data structure which contains similar elements with of any kind of same data type.
*it consists of integers,strings,char only have the same data type.
*it can be represent with [] ,arr[] = 231476 with size 6 .size can be represented with 'n'.
*int arr[] = new int[6];
*if the array is intializes inside or outside it gives or takes the value '0' in java.
*but in c++ if we intialized inside it takes some garbage values if outise it takes it as zeros.
*the maximum length of an array inside main is 10*6//*power in this
*outside the main the length is 10*7// * means power in this.
*the array index starts from 0 to the n-1;
for example : 231476
              012345
the array is stored in computer memory creates a block of an array . the first block is stored in random 'x'
here the 'x' is address location ,it stores the 0th index of an array.
the contigous elements is stored in corresponding elements (x+1,x+2,x+3,x+4,x+5)
problem : find the largest element of an array 
arr[] = {3,2,1,3,2}
solution : public class LargestElement {
            public static int LargestElement(int[] arr) {
              int Largest = arr[0];//first we intialize the 0 as largest 
                for(int i = 1;i < arr.length;i++) {//here we intialize the 0 as largest so we can start with 1 st index 
                   if(arr[i] > largest) {
                      largest = arr[i];
                }
             }
                public static voiid main(String[] args) {
                 int[] arr={3,2,1,3,2};
                  int result = largestelement(arr);
                  System.out.println("largest element is :"+result);
             }
}
